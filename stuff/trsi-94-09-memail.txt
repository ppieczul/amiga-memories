What the fuck..?


You  see,  just another membermail.  Due the fact that Uyanik!  and Warhead
were  on  holidays  the  last month it is my turn to write something useful
about  the  changes in August and about future plans.  Please do not expect
too much because I HAVE alreay written a membermail one day ago...  3 hours
of work, a huge amount of lines and info, but...  Have you ever overwritten
a  textfile  with another?  RAAAAH!  SHIT!  Everything was lost!  Nah, kick
this crap...  That`s life :))


After  the  success  of  VIKTORIA (thx to Virgill, thx to The Twins, thx to
Fiver,  Fade  One  and the other actors) we will release a second Data Disk
quite  soon.   It  will be probably already included in this letter so stay
tuned  (dunno  if  they  are  able to finish it in time).  Expect more Data
Disks...  (hopefully) ;))


The  SlideShow from Fiver was cancelled.  That does NOT mean that they will
never  appear.  The splendid graphics from Fiver WILL NOT be wasted and the
GFX  Show  will  be  released but the code will be done by ERROX and not by
Orbit  anymore!   Orbit  was  put due inactivity into the INACTIVE section!
SHAME  ON  HIM!   He  hasn`t  done  anything  since 6 months so...  A small
CrackIntro  (zIIIIITTZ)  will  be probably coded from him for the Illegals.
Find his address in the Inactive Memberlist.


Good News from Rewired & Co.  Their tRACKMO will be released at the AmiExpo
in  Cologne!   It  will  not  be  focken  chartrunner (as said) but it will
contain  kewl  effects  and  a  good design...  The Fiver SlideShow will be
probably  finished one week after the AmiExpo and they are working on a new
issue  of their PHON-O-BOMB, too; that means 3 releases in a row from these
talented  artists.   NOTE  THIS!   Rewired,  Fiver, Errox and J.L.Picard...
THX!


Btw,  sTREETWARE from your dREAM gROUP nUMBER oNE is available NOW!  Do not
forget  to ORDER your personal tRSI jacket and T-Shirt!  This disk contains
further   information...    READ  THEM!   But  be  quick!   Order  it  now!
Everything will be managed by Rewired (the artist who has drawn the motive)
so remit the money on his account a leave him a message.


The  Viola  Brothers are busy with their SlideShow, too.  The graphics were
drawn  during  one  year of hard work so expect a damned good release (Same
goes  to  the  Slideshow  from  Fiver)!  They DO NOT present their coder so
expect  a  surprise.  I really do not know who is responsible for the code;
they said that it is one of German`s best coders.  Delta`s Return?  hihi

SUICID...  Where the hell is this focken diskmag you may ask?  Gee, you are
right.   I`ve talked with Madison a few days ago.  He says that the code is
more  or  less  finished but Graphics from Navy are still missing.  Navy is
quite busy with his commercial game right now (will be probably finished in
two  weeks)  so  we  could  expect a finished code/outfit of our mag in one
month.   The  it`s Shade`s turn to bring it to the top :)) Btw, Madison has
coded a small crackintro for the Illegal section during this time, too.


Ply2  moved  -  his  new  address  is  available  in  the  updated Inactive
memberlist.   He  is  busy  with  his game right now but a friend of him (a
coder)  tries to join.  We will check him...  Let`s see if he`s good enough
for The Sleeping Gods.


Is  anybody  interested  in coding a Musicdisk/Slideshow?  We have A LOT OF
great  musicians/graphicians  without  a single release!  Take eg.  EMAX or
BLACKTHORNE!   Emax is one of the best musicians I`ve ever heard so it is a
real MUST to produce a MusicDisk for him!  C`me on!

The  new  mebers in the UK are working on a dentro for the DTL party.  They
made already some bootmenus (available on this disk) and will start working
on  a  trackmo  for  the  Party  IV soon.  GREAT!  I really love your menu,
Ditto!  <SMACKS> Everybody who might be interested in doing packdisks leave
me a note, okay?


*--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Shade  is  busy with the mag and the articles.  I have already seen a rough
information  about  the  headlines  and  you  can  be sure that SUICID will
contain a lof of interesting articles!  Btw, we got a new member in Norway.
His  name is Air and he`s a accepted swapper.  Nah, do not be angry because
he`s  just  `simple`  swapper - he is quite important for Shade and for the
mag!   Air  will  be  the editor of our News Corner and will probably start
doing  packdisks aswell.  Welcome mate!  Address and Voice# will follow for
the Memberlist!  Some persons in Norway wanted to join; we will check them.
No prob! :))

A  small  party into with A LOT OF raytraced graphics was released from our
polish members.  The music competition at the Intel Outside Party in Poland
was won by Tap/TRSI and XTD/TRSI.  There were some some changes, too.  Bald
Horse joined, TOM left, Reset left, Pluton renamed to GS and Trash Head was
kicked.   But  here to another topic:  THE RELEASES and THE DATES:  Why the
hell  did  not  KNOW anybody (even not the leaders) about this release?  It
was  uploaded  on  our  WHQ  (Mortuary) by a CLASSIC member!  WHAT A SHAME!
This  CAN  NOT continue!  For heaven`s sake, if you are planning to release
eg.   an  intro  or whatever - CALL US!  Write us a letter!  SEND IT before
publishing  it!  GOT IT?  We got already a lot of problems with the Illegal
section!   It  is  OUR  job  as  leaders,  as  connection between legal and
Illegal, to inform them about demo releases and it is quite sad if even the
leaders  do not know ANYTHING about a polish production.  Next time it will
be NUKED and you have to feel the consequences, okay?  THX!  This shouldn`t
be a warning - take it as hint!

What  the  hell is up with the DANISH members?  I have called several times
without getting a simple comment (it was a simple answering machine).  Send
us  samples and info of/about your productions, okay?  THX!  Btw, Your name
is`n Alfred, Domino.  It is Jeppe, right?  :))

WOW!   It  seems that Domino is still alive, hehe.  I got a letter from him
today  with  rough  info about the future...  T-BONE is back from Brazil so
expect  crackintros  or some other serious things.  The code of their small
fun-mag  was  already  finished  and the first issue will be released soon.
Just wait a bit!


*--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Okay,  that`s  it for now.  Hmmm, I hope that I haven`t forgetten too much,
but  -  as  said  -  I  have  already written a 1st membermail one day ago.
RAAAH!  Live is hard.  Hehe...  For the case that you are interested in the
Illegal  Section,  too.   They have cracked different games during the last
weeks.   Hanse  (Expeditionen), Sternsiedler, Ruesselsheim (Detroit German)
AGA  &  ECS,  Bundesliga Manager Professional (Hattrick) Crackfix, Rings Of
Medusa Gold, King`s Quest VI (German)...  More to follow...  L8er!




Best regards, CONtROL/tRSI <ANDREAS>
